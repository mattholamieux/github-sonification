### Data Sonification of Github Contribution Graphs

This project is an adaptation of [@nielsenjared](https://github.com/nielsenjared)'s ["in-g"](https://github.com/nielsenjared/in-g). 

The project uses [cheeriojs](https://cheerio.js.org/) on the backend to scrape data from github user contribution graphs, and [Tonejs](https://tonejs.github.io/) on the frontend to reinterpret that data into musical sequences.
